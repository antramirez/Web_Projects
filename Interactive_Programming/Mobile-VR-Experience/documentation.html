      <h1>VR Documentation</h1>
      <p>This project was inspired by chaos and dogs. When trying to find 3D models, I thought it would be a nice idea to include dogs. Google Poly fortunately had many options to choose from, so I chose to include a dog in a plane and a corgi. Addtionally, there are many primitive shapes in this world, randomly positioned, giving it a sense of lack of order. However, by using Perlin noise and constraining the positions of all the objects, I tried to contain the disorder. In terms of sound, I wanted the spheres to sound like they were expanding with air when the user clicks on them. When clicking the cubes, I wanted a sound effect to match a color change occuring; I thought a pop sound seemed nice.
