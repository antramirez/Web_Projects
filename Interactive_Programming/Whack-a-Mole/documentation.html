      <p>I don't like to get political, but Kavanaugh does not deserve to be a Supreme Court Justice. I chose to express this anger through the popular game Whack-a-Mole. The user has 30 seconds to whack his face as many times as possible, but if the user hits an empty hole, it counts as a miss. I wanted the game to have various graphics, so I thought it would be neat to include a comic text graphic for when Kavanaugh gets hit and an X for the misses. See the images that inspired this game down below.</p>
